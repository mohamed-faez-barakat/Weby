As Ahmad approached his final year in computer science, he felt the pressure of his graduation

After months of learning and applying what he gained from Weby, Ahmad completed his graduation project
 with a sleek, fully responsive design.
 When he presented it to his professors, they were impressed with the level
  of professionalism and detail.
 Thanks to Weby, Ahmad not only aced his project but also gained the skills
  needed to pursue a career in front-end development.
